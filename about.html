how to SPONSOR A CHILD IN NEED

Save the Children is doing whatever it takes to ensure refugee children are growing up healthy, educated and safe – so they can have the future every child deserves

Your monthly gift of $25 will give your sponsored child access to life-changing benefits, like medical care, educational support, life skills and job training before graduation.

As a sponsor, you'll be able to see your impact firsthand through letters and photos from your child. You can even visit!

Use the search tool to find a special child waiting for a sponsor like you!

Our programs focus on four key outcomes: for refugee kids to graduate healthy, educated, empowered and employed. Why these four? Because they're all interconnected and essential to achieving the big goal: helping to break the cycle of poverty.

Health

Knowledge is power, especially when it comes to getting and staying healthy. So our health programs focus on two important things: 1) developing healthy habits and 2)connecting kids with services when they need help.

Education

Education doesn't have a one-size-fits-all solution. Your support is invested in helping kids complete secondary school using a wide range of tools to make it happen: providing school fees, uniforms, supplies, tutoring and scholarships.

Empowerment

Through empowerment programs that build leadership, teamwork and confidence, you're not only making a brighter future possible, but you're also creating a positive ripple effect on kids' communities.

Employment

Mock interviews, résumé writing, connecting with jobs, earning scholarships for college or  vocational training— CI teens are focused on developing workplace and technical skills to help them change their lives for good.
