		<p>Over 62,000 refugees fleeing violence are stranded in Greece. Nearly 5 million Syrian refugees have fled across the globe. Many have experienced profound physical and emotional traumas.</p>
		<p>Advancing the Ministries of Gospel (AMG International), is currently serving among the Syrian and Iraqi refugees in Thessaloniki, Greece. There are approximately 70,000 refugees currently in Greece after the boarders with the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM) and other regional countries were closed.</p>
		<p>Dimitris Tsoukalas, a missionary with AMG International reports that the need for accommodations has become overwhelming, and that Thessaloniki locals are skeptical to rent homes and apartments to refugees even though EU funds are available to cover rental fees.</p>
		<p>Dimitris and AMG are working with those in despair and without hope. Many of the refugees have family members in other European countries that they are trying to reunite - a process which may take several months to a year.</p>
		<p>In Thessaloniki, AMG has adopted six refugee camps out of the existing 21. Besides food, the missions organization is providing clothing, medical services, and hygiene materials. Dimitris shared that more than 45% of the refugees are children, 21% are women, and the remainder are men.</p>
		<p>Project Kidsart is focused on assisting Dimitris and his colleagues at AMG. AMG is currently working to open a day center that can offer bathrooms, laundry facilities, a play area for children, and a space for adults to meet with psychologists and lawyers.</p>
